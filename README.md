# NumberSeriesProgramming   
A JavaFX program using the Fibonacci Sequence and Prime Numbers.    

# How to run this application   
Run this in Java 8, not the latest Java SDK version   

# Objective   
For this test, you will be required to write a program that calculates sequences of numbers.  
A sequence of numbers is a list of numbers that are governed by some sort of pattern or rule.   
For instance, the “sequence of odd numbers” has the following rules:  
• It starts at 1  
• It increments by 2  
• Example: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11  

# Requirements  
Your program will be required to calculate the following sequences of numbers   
• Fibonacci Sequence  
• Prime Numbers   
If you don’t know what they are, you can Google them to learn their rules   

# Programming Rules   
You are required to use the Java language   
• We don’t mind which JVM, JRE, and JDK you use   
• You can use any IDE you like  
• You cannot use any external libraries except for the core JDK libraries   

# Required Output     
For both sequences    
• The first 10 numbers must be calculated   
You must provide us a Java program with all source code   
The code you provide must contain at least one of the following   
• A “main” method that demonstrates the first 10 numbers of each sequence being calculated and output on the screen   
• Unit tests which demonstrate the first 10 numbers of each sequence being calculated and tested against the known values
